All sounds were recorded at 24-bit, 96kHz Stereo, and lovingly cleaned so that all you hear is the beauty of the sound--no background noise!

I use TK's Nomenclature fore naming all audio assets. I came up with this scheme so that you can look at a sound effect file, and be able to know what it's going to sound like without even needing to open it up. It's also useful if your directories get scattered--you'll know exactly where the sound should go.

I absolutely loved recording the sounds and getting them ready for use in your game. I hope you love them, too!
